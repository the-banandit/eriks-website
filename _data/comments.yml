  - comment: "I think the atmosphere was the best. Some students were better than me and some more slow. I think what could be done is provide challenging exercises to do not to evaluate but for those students who want to do a bit more. Maybe, the professor don't have to correct them but those difficult things we cannot answer would be asked in class."
